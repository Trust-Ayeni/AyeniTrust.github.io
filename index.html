                      <h1 class = "Hello">Hello All ! I'm Lekan <span class="wave">👋</span></h1>
                      <p>My name is Lekan, and I just made the jump from being a Java developer to a Python developer because I am passionate about utilizing this amazing language to solve difficult issues and because I can always come up with new, creative ideas while using it.
                        I have a strong history in Python software development using IDEs like PyCharm, VSCode, and sublime text.
                        Knowledge of the Python Framework
                        Use of the Python Pandas libraries during the development lifecycle. 
                        Excellent knowledge of Python programming on the Linux operating system (Ubuntu).
                        written SQL queries, stored procedures, functions, packages, tables, views, and triggers with experience.
                        Experience examining Python code for the purpose of performing troubleshooting test-cases and bug concerns.


                        My top five strengths in order are Humility, Perspective, Kindness, and Determination. Don't be fooled, I speak up about my opinions without fear of judgment or disagreement, and I do stand up for myself and my loved ones when injustice or discrimination occurs. In fact, I don't often think of myself as better than others; instead, I look for opportunities to learn from those who understand things better than I do.

                        In terms of my perspective, I tend to view things from many angles. When someone says anything, I appear to consider it from a variety of perspectives, including: What does this person mean? Why did he/she act that manner or say that? It simply appears to be a natural process taking place in my head.
                        When I see those who are struggling, I too experience agony. Being kind involves more than simply seeing when someone is struggling; it also moves me to provide assistance. On several instances, I have helped folks who needed financial aid and explanations for a certain task or course work.
                        My colleagues and friends love me for this.

                        Determination is my final strong suit. My perseverance is a result of a variety of reasons, one of which is the numerous challenging experiences that have made me strong-willed and confident.
                        As a result of the numerous challenging experiences I had, including bullying in high school and discrimination based on my faith, I became psychologically stronger, developed a thicker skin to withstand the negative comments, and gained more self-assurance. It indicates that the most important psychological components that lead to the formation of determination are having a solid value system, hope, optimism, and self-confidence.

                        By enabling me to have self-confidence, take chances, and have great leadership abilities, determination helps me reach my life goals. One of the key ingredients to achieving your life objectives is having self-confidence.
                        For me, the keys to achieving goals in life are having faith in one's talents, disregarding what others say, and having the strength to defend oneself. Due to concerns about "what people would think," shame, and rejection, many individuals are averse to taking chances to accomplish their goals. Even if these outcomes seem unpleasant, the majority of successful individuals would contend that failure is a necessary component of development, acting as both a steppingstone to success and a motivator for personal improvement.

                        I graduated last year with my degree in Computer Science, and I’m excited to get my first position in the industry, now. I have several career goals. The first career goal is to gain employment with your company, to get up to speed in the role quickly and to become a productive and trustworthy employee. My second career goal is that I want to learn and develop in the position. I plan to undertake and complete internal training development courses that will allow me to be a consistent high performer.
                        Another one of my career goals is that I want to eventually gain promotion within your company. I want to build a long-term career with your company, and I believe I can eventually progress to a higher level. Finally, another one of my career goal is that I want to expand my professional network. I believe you are only as good in your career as the people around you, and I plan to build a strong and helpful network that enables me to achieve the objectives set by my employer. I saw this job offers exposure to a variety of areas, which is something I liked.
